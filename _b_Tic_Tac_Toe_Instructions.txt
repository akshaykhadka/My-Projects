How to play ?

1. The position of 'The Board' is set as follows:

                              |     |
                           7  |  8  |  9
                              |     |
                          ---------------
                              |     |
                           4  |  5  |  6
                              |     |
                          ---------------
                              |     |
                           1  |  2  |  3
                              |     |

2. Player 1 gets to choose the marking from either 'X' or 'O'.

3. Player 2 is automatically assigned the other marking.
   Eg. If Player 1 chooses 'X' then the Player 2 gets 'O'

4. Turn by turn both the players have to choose their positions 
   and place the marking.

5. The Player who 'first' manages to place it's marking either 
   horizontally, vertically or digonally wins the game.

6. The game is Tied if no one manages the Step 5.
