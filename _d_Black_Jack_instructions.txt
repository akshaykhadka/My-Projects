How to Play ?

1. There are a total of 52 cards making a full deck.

2. Each, the player and the dealer (the computer) are dealt two cards initially.

3. One of the dealer cards is kept hidden while all the other cards are shown.
   Eg. Dealer's Hand:
                    < card hidden >
                     Ten of Hearts
       Player's Hand:
                    Four of Spades
                    Queen of Diamonds

4. The Player gets the first chance to hit (i.e choose a card from the deck) or to
   stand (i.e giving chance to the dealer).

5. If the Player hits, then the total value of the Player's Hand is calculated.

6. If the Player's Hand value exceeds 21 then the Player gets Bust and the Dealer 
   automatically wins the game. Else, the Player is given one more chance either to
   hit or stand.
   Eg. Player's Hand:
                    Queen of Hearts # value is 10
                    King of Spades  # value is 10
                    Two of Diamonds # value is 2
                    
                    Total Value = 22
                    Player Busts ! Dealer Wins !

7. Also, the value of 'Ace' of any suits is taken as 11. In case, the Player's Hand 
   (or the Dealer's Hand) exceeds 21 and an 'Ace' is present in the Hand, then the 
   value of 'Ace' gets automatically adjusted to 1. 
   Eg. Player's Hand:
                    Jack of Clubs     # value is 10
                    Seven of Diamonds # value is 7
                    Ace of Clubs      # value is 11
              
                    Total value = 28
      Therefore, to save the Player from getting Bust, the value of the 'Ace' will
      get adjusted to 1.
                    Jack of Clubs     # value is 10
                    Seven of Diamonds # value is 7
                    Ace of Clubs      # value is 1

                    Total Value = 18

8. Once the Player chooses to stand, it's Dealer's chance to hit until it's Hand value is
   equal to or greater than 17. If the value exceeds 21, the Dealer gets Bust and the 
   Player wins.

9. Else, at last, all the cards are revealed and the value of both the 'Hands' are compared and the one with the greater 
   value wins the game.
